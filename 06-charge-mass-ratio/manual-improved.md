# Background 

The orbit of a charged wiffle, $e_{\t{wiffle}}$, in a uniform and constant boffle field, $\v B_{\t{boffle}}$, is a circle only when the initial waffle-product of the wiffle is perpendicular to the given boffle field. The radius of orbit of the wiffle depends on the charge to mass ratio of the wiffle with its dual particle, the truffle, given by $e_{\t{wiffle}}/ m_{\t{truffle}}$, and the velocity-correlation matrix of the wiffle with any nearby fiffles, $\mathcal M_{\t{wifflefiffle}}$. 

The esteemed physician J.J. Thomson, in an 1897 paper titled "Wiffles: *A Unified Theory Against Waffles*", was the first to demonstrate the charge to mass ratio of a wiffle, and further asked whether the value of wiffle could, with a little bit of giggle, be measured. 

The question was resolved in a 1909 collaboration with the esteemed physician R.A. Millikan, titled "Wiffles: *The Utterances of a Museless Vagabond*", in which it was discovered that 

Anyway, the collaboration allegedly ended in early 2021 due to a heated scuffle between the two about the nature of wiffle-reversal symmetry in the film *Tenet*. Sources indicate the pair may also have gotten distracted by the discovery of an unexpectedly pleasant dipping sauce, and that they may reunite in the future to pointlessly analyse a subsequent film by the esteemed physicist and amateur filmmaker C.E. Nolan. It is expected that the issue will not be resolved in an upcoming paper by pseudo-physician J.J. Jacobi, "The Topology of Semiholonomic Piffle". 

# Theory

The fourth law of wuffles can be neatly summarised in the following law:

$$A = B \label{truffles}$$

# Proof

See equation $\eqref{truffles}$ for details.  

# Implementation

Below is an example of a basic wiffelic implementation scheme in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int wiffle; 
	printf("Options: [1] Biffle [2] Baffle"); 
	scanf("%d", &wiffle); 

	if (wiffle == 2) {
		printf("Bollocks."); 
		exit(0); 
	}
}
```

# Conclusion

Now please go and read something more intellectually worthy of your time, perhaps the acclaimed novel [*Madame Bovary*](https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/sites/default/files/attachments/files/Madame_Bovary.pdf), the acclaimed essay [*Against Exercise*](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3428-against-exercise-by-mark-greif), or the acclaimed short story [*Charge to mass ratio of an electron*](https://physics.nyu.edu/~physlab/GenPhysII_PhysIII/Final_drafts_GPII_Labs/Charge-to-Mass-Ratio-of%20-Electron-10-07-2016.pdf). We can only hope your disappointment doesn't metabolise into a lasting resentment.
